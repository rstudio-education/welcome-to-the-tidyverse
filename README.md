## Course Abstract

Looking for an effective way to learn R? This one day course will teach you a workflow for doing data science with the R language. It focuses on using R's Tidyverse, which is a core set of R packages that are known for their impressive performance and ease of use. We will focus on doing data science, not programming. You'll learn to:

* Visualize data with R's ggplot2 package
* Wrangle data with R's dplyr package
* Fit models with base R, and 
* Document your work reproducibly with R Markdown

Along the way, you will practice using R's syntax, gaining comfort with R through many exercises and examples. Bring your laptop! The workshop will be taught by Garrett Grolemund, an award winning instructor and the co-author of R for Data Science.
